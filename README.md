- [2024-11-11]: Support for different sequence lengths between `q` and `k,v`,  `(batch_size, head_num, seq_len, head_dim)` or `(batch_size, seq_len, head_num, head_dim)` input shapes, and `group-query attention` is available now.


## Installation
### Base environment
+ `python>=3.9`   , `torch>=2.3.0`  , `triton>=3.0.0` 
- `CUDA`:
  + `>=12.8` for Blackwell
  + `>=12.4` for fp8 support on Ada
  + `>=12.3` for fp8 support on Hopper
  + `>=12.0` for Ampere
+ `flash-attn` for benchmarking

### Install Package

For SageAttention V1 in Triton (slower than SageAttention V2/V2++/V3), refer to [SageAttention-1](https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention/tree/sageattention-1) and install using pip: `pip install sageattention==1.0.6`

To use SageAttention 2.1.1, please **compile from source**:
```
git clone https://github.com/thu-ml/SageAttention.git
cd SageAttention 
python setup.py install  # or pip install -e .
```

To benchmark the speed against FlashAttention3, please compile FlashAttention3 from source:
```
git clone https://github.com/Dao-AILab/flash-attention.git --recursive
git checkout b7d29fb3b79f0b78b1c369a52aaa6628dabfb0d7 # 2.7.2 release
cd hopper
python setup.py install
```

## How to Use
```python
from sageattention import sageattn
attn_output = sageattn(q, k, v, tensor_layout="HND", is_causal=False)
```
+ `q, k, v` are **FP16/BF16** dtype with the shape `(batch_size, head_num, seq_len, head_dim)` using default `tensor_layout="HND"`. For shape `(batch_size, seq_len, head_num, head_dim)`, set `tensor_layout="NHD"`. 
+ `is_causal` determines the use of a causal mask.

### Available APIs:
+ `sageattn`: Automatically selects the optimal kernel based on the GPU to achieve a good performance-accuracy trade-off.
+ `sageattn_qk_int8_pv_fp16_triton`: INT8 quantization for $QK^\top$ and FP16 for $PV$ using Triton backend.
+ `sageattn_qk_int8_pv_fp16_cuda`: INT8 quantization for $QK^\top$ and FP16 for $PV$ using CUDA backend.
+ `sageattn_qk_int8_pv_fp8_cuda`: INT8 quantization for $QK^\top$ and FP8 for $PV$ using CUDA backend.
+ `sageattn_qk_int8_pv_fp8_cuda_sm90`: INT8 quantization for $QK^\top$ and FP8 for $PV$ using CUDA backend, specifically optimized for Hopper GPUs.
+ `sageattn_varlen`: INT8 quantization for $QK^\top$ and FP16 for $PV$ using Triton backend. Support for varying sequence lengths within the same batch.

For optimal speed and accuracy performance on custom devices and models, we strongly recommend referring to the [this file](./sageattention/core.py) for detailed guidance.

> **Note:**
Support for different sequence lengths between `q` and `k,v` and `group-query attention` is available.


### Plug-and-play Example

We can replace `scaled_dot_product_attention` easily. 
We will take [CogvideoX](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/CogVideoX-2b) as an example:

Add the following codes and run
```diff
import torch.nn.functional as F

+ from sageattention import sageattn
+ F.scaled_dot_product_attention = sageattn

```

Specifically,

```bash
cd example
python cogvideox-2b.py --compile --attention_type sage
```

**You can get a lossless video in** `./example` **faster than by using** `python cogvideox-2b.py --compile`. More examples and guidance can be found under the `example/` directory.

> **Note:** Not all models works with `F.scaled_dot_product_attention = sageattn`. Technically, you should replace the original Attention by modifying the `Attention Class` of the target model. For image and video models, we suggest only replacing the attention in DiT (see `example/mochi.py` for detail).

### Kernel Benchmarking
We provide a benchmarking script to compare the speed of different kernels including SageAttention, FlashAttention2 and FlashAttention3. Please refer to the `benchmark/` directory for more details.
 
## Performance
### Speed of Kernels

`8+8` means the kernel with INT8 quantization for $QK^\top$ and FP8 quantization for $PV$. `8+16` uses FP16 with FP16 accumulator for $PV$.
